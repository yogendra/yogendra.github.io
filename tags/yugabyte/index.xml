I have been working with YugabyteDB for a while now. I am always experimenting with YugabyteDB + (something). Today, its Vault.
I have also worked on Vault for a bit and did a a lightening talk earlier this year. That talks was primarily around the data masking. But today, I was exploring the database secret engine.
For the uninitiated, Vault provides you with ability to dynamically generate database credentials for your application.</description></item><item><title>Fun With Sensors' Data</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2022/04/11/fun-with-sensors-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 01:50:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2022/04/11/fun-with-sensors-data/</guid><description>
IoT is growing rapidly. I wanted to learn more about it from an enterprise and data centric aspect of it. Here are initial learnings</description></item><item><title>YugabyteDB - Row Level Geo Partitioning</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2022/03/17/yugabytedb-row-level-geo-partitioning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 23:31:47 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2022/03/17/yugabytedb-row-level-geo-partitioning/</guid><description>
I have joined Yugabyte a while back. I have gone through many demos/samples. But one thing that caught my attention very early on was the geo-pinning the data.
This capability can simplify compliance of data privacy laws, data sovereignty laws, etc. It can make the overall architecture of the application very simple. Here is my stab at this feature. I followed the documentation for most part. I added only the cluster management parts to the whole guide for a quick self-drive.</description></item></channel></rss>
