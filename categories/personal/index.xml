&lt;p>यह दिवाली आपकी, जीवन बने खुशियों का सागर।
स्वस्थ तन-मन और धन से, भर उठे जीवन की गागर।
दीन, दीपक रोशनी के, समन्वय को दे दिशा हम।
बांटकर खुशियाँ करे हम, रोशनी मन की उजागर।&lt;/p>
&lt;p>दीप बनकर कालिमा का, तम हरें खुद को जलाकर
दीन की झोली भरें हम, हर्ष की लड़ीयाँ जलाकर।
दीपमाला की लड़ी से, प्रेरणा हमको मिले कि,
साथ में दीपक जले, &amp;lsquo;नोरत&amp;rsquo; लगे नभ में प्रभाकर I&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ नोरतन&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parenting Lessons !!</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/12/22/parenting-lessons/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 15:58:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/12/22/parenting-lessons/</guid><description>

And My Heart Skipped A Beat</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/04/29/...-and-my-heart-skipped-a-beat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 19:02:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/04/29/...-and-my-heart-skipped-a-beat/</guid><description>
&lt;p>27th April 2015, Monday - A date that has become even more special. Its Srishti&amp;rsquo;s (my niece) birthday. She turned 4. Everyone who knows me, know it well, how special she is to me. But God had his own plans to take this to a whole new level.
test&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this day, I woke up a Son, Brother, Husband, Brother In Law and Uncle. And Ashu woke up as Daughter, Sister, Wife, Sister In Law and Aunty. But, in a miraculous moment, I became a Father, she became a Mother and we both became Parents. We are blessed with a lovely &lt;strong>DAUGHTER&lt;/strong>. It still feels like a dream. And if it is one,  I wish I never wake up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Golden Thoughts Of Thiruvalluvar</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/03/10/some-golden-thoughts-of-thiruvalluvar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 07:22:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/03/10/some-golden-thoughts-of-thiruvalluvar/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Tirukkural by Tiruvalluvar (A Tamil - poet/writer) was written more than 5000 yrs ago. It’s one of the ancient science on Human behavior, which has not changed dispite of modern education &amp;amp; technology&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="thiruvalluvar.gif" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child lies to you often, it is because you over-react too harshly to their inappropriate behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is not taught to confide in you about their mistakes, you’ve lost them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child had poor self-esteem, it is because you advice them more than you encourage them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child does not stand up for themselves, it is because from a young age you have disciplined them regularly in public.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child takes things that do not belong to them, it is because when you buy them things, you don’t let them chose what they want.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is cowardly, it is because you help them too quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child does not respect other people’s feelings, it is because instead of speaking to your child, you order and command them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is too quick to anger, it is because you give too much attention to misbehavior and you give little attention to good behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is excessively jealous, it is because you only congratulate them when they successfully complete something and not when they improve at something even if they don’t successfully complete it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child intentionally disturbs you, it is because you are not physically affectionate enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is openly defiant, it is because you openly threaten to do something but don’t follow through.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child is secretive, it is because they don’t trust that you won’t blow things out of proportion.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child talks back to you, it is because they watch you do it to others and think its normal behavior.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child doesn’t listen to you but listens to others, it is because you are too quick to jump to conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If your child rebels it is because they know you care more about what others think than what is right.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Please forward this to all. It MAY GUIDE OUR MODERN PARENTS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2015</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/01/01/happy-new-year-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:58:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/01/01/happy-new-year-2015/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I have been thinking about blogging regularly, but with amount of work, home chores and everything in between, idea just gets lost. Then again being lazy me is not easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway if I can write quick posts from phone, may be it might just work. It could be as short as a Tweet or G+ update. If I can get a decent 1 entry per week, I would be happy though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read a lot about programming, mobile platforms, etc., so I can comment about those here. I have no monetizing objective behind this at the moment and don&amp;rsquo;t have any plan in long term future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fond Farewell, Warm Welcome and Happy Housewarming</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2012/01/01/fond-farewell-warm-welcome-and-happy-housewarming/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 21:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2012/01/01/fond-farewell-warm-welcome-and-happy-housewarming/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Its that time of the year when everyone looks back at the year gone by and look forward to the new year, in a new spirit. I too decided that I would make some changes and new commitments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="old-new.jpg" alt="type-banner">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of this year I have invested time and money to amass some web assets, but never had enough time and inclination to put them to good use. I have had a stale blog before thi with an average of 3 posts per year (duh). Apart from that, there is always a fear of starting flame wars, misquoting, etc. So, its only apt to get started now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year has given me many fond memories. I was uncle again, India won a cricket world cup, house was renovated, my SGS2, my first macbook, short getaway at Bintan and many more. And as usual there were a few not so find memories like India&amp;rsquo;s white wash tour of England (wth).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I look forward to next year with many plans in mind. One of them is maintaining thia site. This sure will become center of my social networking.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
