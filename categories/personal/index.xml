Tirukkural by Tiruvalluvar (A Tamil - poet/writer) was written more than 5000 yrs ago. It’s one of the ancient science on Human behavior, which has not changed dispite of modern education &amp;amp; technology
If your child lies to you often, it is because you over-react too harshly to their inappropriate behavior.
If your child is not taught to confide in you about their mistakes, you’ve lost them.
If your child had poor self-esteem, it is because you advice them more than you encourage them.</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2015</title><link>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/01/01/happy-new-year-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:58:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yogendra.github.io/2015/01/01/happy-new-year-2015/</guid><description>
