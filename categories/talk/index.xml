&lt;p>I am a Co-Manager for &lt;a href="https://www.gdg-sg.org">Google Developer Group - Singapore&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/gdgsgorg">FB&lt;/a>). And today was our annual &lt;a href="https://www.gdg-sg.org/2017/10/gdg-devfest-2017.html">GDG-SG DevFest 2017&lt;/a> event. Apart from being an organizer, I was also a speaker.
